# WatchCom - Laravel Application


Welcome to **WatchCom**! This is a simple online watch store built with **Laravel**.
Also, my first self hosted project


### **Features So Far:**
- **MySQL Database:** For storing product info, user data, and orders[in a cart somehow i managed to forget the cliche].
- **Custom Login & Registration:** Users can create accounts and log in.
- **Products & Details Pages:** Browse products and view detailed info.
- **Cart Functionality:** Add products to the cart and adjust quantities.

### **Whatâ€™s Missing:**
- **Admin Panel:** No admin interface yet. Products are managed directly via **phpMyAdmin**.
- **Checkout Process**:ofc can't connect to none payment gateways, i am not a merchant to use it as a tester in Nepal


Note: This mini project simply defines the base of how a folder struture works, testing & implementing literally anything, i will be using this same concept in other vague projects like **pokemonJP**

# do i need help?

_The base folder structure is still incomplete. While Laravel handles most of the setup, I would appreciate assistance with merging any admin-related routing and other necessary components_
